# exerimental_kernal

### repository description

**A toy OS kernal**

Performance has never been our goal, we wanted a kernel that was rich in functionality to run correctly.

I try to comply with the POSIX specification, but this is not guaranteed.

### Target Platform

The target platform is x86_64 PC. Usually it's can run with a PC simulator.

### How to run

For now, too many works not finish, it's cant run yet, please wait.

### What am I doing now

I'm writing the bootloader for kernal, it'll probably take a few weeks.

### The follow-up work

After the kernal work normally, a JVM and a Lua interpreter will be implemented based on it.
